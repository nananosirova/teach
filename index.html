                <h3>Announcements</h3>
                <p>Teachings Labs will be closed Tuesday Dec 20 2pm - Wednesday Jan 4 2pm</p>
                <p>Starting Fall 2016: Student accounts are now UTORids. Existing accounts were renamed to UTORid, with passwords
                    remaining unchanged.</p>
                <p>To get yourself started we recommend that you read the First Year or New User's Guide and/or the Teaching Labs
                    Users Guide, which is oriented towards second year and higher students.

                    Your Teaching Labs username is your UTORid. You will be emailed an initial password which you will have to
                    change on first use. Your password is unique to the teaching labs: you can set it to whatever you want
                    (subject to password quality constraints), it does not have to be the same as your UTOR login. You can
                    make it the same if you want, but it's safer to choose a unique password. If you forget it, you can reset
                    your teaching lab password via the Teaching Labs web page under Resources: Account Management.</p>

                <h3>About Teaching Labs</h3>
                <p>The labs in the Bahen Centre are accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during term time. Access is controlled
                    by a card-access lock system that restricts entry to authorized individuals. To enter one of the labs you will
                    need to swipe your T-Card through the card reader that is installed outside of each door.</p>

                <h3>What are the Computer Science Teaching Labs?</h3>
                <p>These are a set of computer labs and computing environments provided by the Department of Computer Science to
                    support Computer Science courses. The primary environment is Ubuntu Linux.</p>

                <h3>Where are the labs located?</h3>
                <p>The labs are located in:</p>
                <p>Bahen Centre for Information Technology (40 St George St). <br>
                    The labs are located in the following Bahen rooms: <br>
                    BA2200, BA2210, BA2220, BA2230, BA2240, BA2270, BA3175, BA3185, BA3195, BA3200, BA3219.</p>

                <h3>Student Secure Website</h3>
                <p>The teaching labs web server has a collection of online software tools to aid students with their courses
                    and assignments. At present these consist of submitting your assignments electronically and checking your
                    course deadlines. To access these utilities, you will need to login with your teaching labs account and password.
                    Since you may be transmitting data that is private to you, we use the HTTPS protocol to ensure all communications
                    are encrypted. One further note: In order to use the system you need to have cookies enabled in the browser.
                    Most browsers accept cookies by default, so if you haven't disabled that feature, you don't need to do
                    anything to enable it. To access the secure website, click

                <h3>Introduction For New Students Using the Computer Science Teaching Labs</h3>
                <p>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science. Click <a href="#">here</a> to get information about
                    using DCS Teaching labs.</p>

                <h3>How do I get an account?</h3>
                <p>In the past if you are an undergraduate student and are enrolled in one of the Computer Science Specialist
                    or Major programs at the St. George campus, you were allowed to request a different sort of account on the
                    Teaching Labs machine called a "program account". It had more generous quota allocations, for example.
                    We don't do that anymore: instead, if you are in one of the programs, your Teaching Labs account will
                    automatically be given the more generous quota allocations that your enrolment in the program allows you
                    to receive. You do not need to do anything for this to happen.</p>

                <h3>Account Management</h3>
                <p>This allows you to change your password if you have forgotten it, activate your new account or refresh your account to "as new" status.</p>
